Utility framework to facilitate development of automated text processing

## Background
Participated in data automation projects, I observed that banks have a great need in parsing financial documents automatically. One of the greatest challenges in such projects comes from the variety of sources. This project attempts to abstract the underlying format of financial documents and provide standardized structured data suitable for NLP models and applications, minimizing the effort to accommodate the varieties.

TLDR: Less time coding and more time training

##This project is WIP
##Very welcome on feature suggestions or improving the efficiency of algorithm
