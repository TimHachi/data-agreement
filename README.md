Utility framework to facilitate development of automated text processing
## Background
Participated in data automation projects, I observed that banks have a great need to parsing financial documents automatically. One of the greatest challenges in such projects comes from a variety of sources. This project attempts to abstract the underlying format of financial documents and provide standardized structured data suitable for NLP models and applications, minimizing the effort to accommodate the varieties.
